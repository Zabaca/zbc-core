// cloudflare-access — a Zero Trust application and the list of principals that
// may reach it, as repo state instead of dashboard state.
//
// What this exists for: `cloudflare-tunnel` puts a hostname on the internet,
// and a tunnel with no policy in front of it is an open door. Declaring the two
// together means "add the route and secure it after" is not a sequence anybody
// has to be trusted to finish.
//
// ── TWO KINDS OF PRINCIPAL, AND THEY DO NOT SHARE A POLICY ────────────────
// A person is admitted by their address, on a policy whose decision is `allow`.
// A machine is admitted by a service token, on a policy whose decision is
// `non_identity` — Service Auth in the dashboard. The two are NOT
// interchangeable: an `allow` policy demands an identity, so a service token on
// one is admitted by nothing while the policy looks perfectly configured, and
// an address on a `non_identity` policy is the mirror of that.
//
// So each declared policy is compared against its OWN idea of a match, and this
// is the property most easily lost by a later edit. Declaring a service-token
// policy makes a non-address rule a legitimate thing for SOME policy to carry,
// and the cheap way to permit that is to loosen the check for all of them —
// which would let an `everyone` rule sit beside the addresses on the people
// policy and read as unchanged. `planPolicies` is the seam that keeps it, and
// `index.test.ts` fails if anybody widens it.
//
// ── THE ORGANISATION IS NOT SCOPED TO THIS APPLICATION ────────────────────
// `teamDomain`, `orgName` and `identityProviders` are properties of the whole
// Zero Trust organisation, not of the application this instance declares. An
// instance pointed at an account converges the provider set behind EVERY
// application in it. That is why undeclared providers are reported and never
// removed, and why `identityProviders` defaults to empty: an instance that says
// nothing about providers converges nothing about them, so adding this module
// to an account cannot disturb it by omission.
//
// ── `auth_domain` IS COMPARED AND NEVER CHOSEN ───────────────────────────
// A consumer's Worker derives the issuer it verifies every assertion against
// from the team domain. An apply that could CHOOSE that value would turn the
// guard into the exact failure the guard exists to catch: edit the file, apply,
// and the issuer plus every live session break at once while the apply reports
// success. So the live value is compared first and only ever echoed back.
// `orgName` is cosmetic, and is the only organisation field this module decides.
//
// ── Deletion is opt-in, and here that is a sharper trade than usual ───────
// `allowDelete` defaults to false, matching cloudflare-zone. The asymmetry
// worth stating: an undeclared DNS record is inert, and an undeclared ALLOW
// policy on this application is an open door somebody added by hand. So an
// extra policy is reported at the top of its voice and counted into the
// outputs, and removing it is still a deliberate second edit rather than
// something a converge loop does on sight.
//
// ── The service token secret is NOT rolled on every apply ─────────────────
// `cloudflare-token` rolls its value every apply and persists nothing, which is
// the better discipline — a minted value that lives only in memory cannot go
// stale in a file somewhere. That does NOT work here, and the asymmetry looks
// like an oversight otherwise. A Cloudflare API token's consumer is this apply.
// An Access service token's consumer is somebody ELSE, deployed from a
// different repo on a different cadence, so rolling on every apply would
// invalidate the credential that consumer holds and take it down until it was
// redeployed. So: created once, thereafter REUSED, never rotated. `rotate: true`
// is the deliberate escape hatch for the day it leaks.
//
// There is deliberately no `destroy`. Destroying an Access application does not
// tidy anything up, it takes the lock off the door.
