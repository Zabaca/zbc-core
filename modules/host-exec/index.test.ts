// Contributed from foundry, 2026-08-18, with `host-exec/index.ts`. The
// `ADR-NNNN` numbers and the `remote-guests/NN` ticket ids below are
// **foundry's**, not this repository's — kept rather than stripped for the
// reason its sibling gives, and named here so a reader does not resolve them
// against an ADR of the same number that this repository may mint later.
//
// The seam has to be held to the standard it was built to impose.
//
// `tailscale-serve`'s tests now run its real `apply` against a fake machine, and
// that is the point of this module. But those tests only ever exercise the
// *substituted* half: `withExec` installs a fake, so `executeOnThisMachine` —
// the branch that actually reaches the box — is never entered by them. An
// untested real path inside the seam is the same defect the seam exists to
// remove, one level down, so it is entered here.
//
// The commands below are real. `printf`, `false`, `cat` and `sleep` are the
// smallest things that can distinguish the choices this file makes from their
// absence: what is captured, what is thrown, what stdin is connected to, and
// whether a timeout is passed on at all. Nothing here touches machine state —
// that is exactly why these four and not, say, `tailscale`.
