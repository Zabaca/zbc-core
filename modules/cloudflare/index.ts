/**
 * cloudflare — deploys a Cloudflare Worker (optionally with static assets, a
 * Durable Object, and a Container) via `wrangler deploy`.
 *
 * This is a THIN orchestrator, the same shape as the turso module: `apply` runs
 * on the operator machine, reads CF creds through `ctx.secret`, runs an optional
 * local build, then shells `wrangler deploy` in the package's own directory. The
 * Worker TOPOLOGY (name, assets binding, durable_objects, containers,
 * migrations) lives in that package's `wrangler.jsonc` — wrangler is the source
 * of truth for it, not this module. That keeps the module reusable for both
 * plain assets Workers (e.g. a static Astro/Next site) and container-backed
 * payloads (e.g. a DO-bound NATS server).
 *
 * Auth is non-interactive: wrangler reads `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` +
 * `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` from the environment, so no `wrangler login` is
 * needed. Worker secrets (e.g. CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN) are pushed via
 * `wrangler secret put`, piped through stdin so no secret value is ever
 * interpolated into a command string.
 *
 * NOTE on containers (Phase B): `wrangler deploy` builds the container image
 * with Docker, so Docker must be running locally at apply time, and the account
 * must be on a Workers Paid plan with Containers enabled. A plain assets Worker
 * (Phase A) has neither requirement.
 *
 * Two config knobs shape WHICH worker a given apply targets:
 *   - `wranglerEnv` selects a named `env.<name>` block in the package's
 *     wrangler.jsonc (`--env`), so one package can ship distinct workers per zbc
 *     environment from a single config file.
 *   - `workerName` renames the deployed worker (`--name`), which is what powers
 *     per-PR preview workers (`zbc-<app>-pr-<N>`). The `*.workers.dev` deploy-URL
 *     regex still matches a renamed worker's URL.
 *
 * IMPORT SYNC: `workerSecrets` and `workerVars` entries can be either a plain
 * name (resolved from this environment's secrets.yaml, exactly as before) or a
 * `{ name, from, output }` reference into an imported instance's outputs
 * (`ctx.output({ from, output }, field)`, resolved by the engine from that
 * instance's validated outputs). Secrets are pushed via `wrangler secret put`, piped
 * through stdin; vars are passed as `wrangler deploy --var KEY:VALUE`. The two
 * are deliberately separate fields — a var is visible in `wrangler.jsonc`/the
 * dashboard, a secret is not — so an imported value's exposure is an explicit
 * per-entry choice, never inferred. Referencing an instance not listed in this
 * instance's `imports`, or an output key that instance doesn't emit, is a hard
 * error naming both.
