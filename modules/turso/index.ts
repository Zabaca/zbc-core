/**
 * Retry `probe` until it stops throwing.
 *
 * WHY, stated carefully, because THREE confident explanations for this have
 * already been wrong (two mine, one a reviewer's). On 2026-08-01 a preview
 * deploy 404'd connecting to a database created 326ms earlier. The root cause
 * was never established. What IS established, each checked rather than
 * reasoned:
 *
 *   - Only the fastest run failed. Four creates, by create-to-connect gap:
 *     326ms 404, 662ms OK, 1263ms OK, 1414ms OK.
 *   - The `<db>-<org>.turso.io` URL the old code built was NOT the cause. It
 *     still answers 200, and two earlier previews created databases and
 *     migrated through it fine.
 *   - A create-then-connect race did NOT reproduce from a workstation: three
 *     fresh databases answered at ~140ms. That rules it out from here, not
 *     from CI, which runs on a different network.
 *
 * So: a bounded retry for a transient failure whose mechanism is unknown, not
 * a fix for a diagnosed bug. If it fires, capture the timing and the response
 * body, because that is the evidence nobody has yet. Do not write a cause into
 * this comment without evidence that survives someone trying to break it.
 *
 * Probes reachability rather than retrying migrate() itself, so a genuine
 * migration error still fails on the first try instead of being attempted
 * `attempts` times and reported as a timeout.

/**
 * `@libsql/client` and `drizzle-orm` are turso's OPTIONAL dependencies, and this
 * is the seam that keeps them optional.
 *
 * Only the `migrationsDir` branch of `apply` touches them, so `registry.json`
 * lists them under `optionalDependencies` and `zbc add turso` does not pull
 * drizzle into a repository that has no migrations to run. A plain
 * `await import('@libsql/client')` contradicts that: it is a module TypeScript
 * must resolve at compile time, so every consumer that took the module at its
 * word and skipped them compiles three unresolvable imports — `modules/` is the
 * tree they vendor, so the errors are theirs, not just ours.
 *
 * Going through a specifier the compiler cannot fold to a literal moves that
 * resolution to runtime, where the branch has already established the package is
 * installed. The types below are the price: the surface used is written out here
 * rather than read off the real package, so it has to be kept honest by hand.
 * Both are small and neither is on a version we pin.
