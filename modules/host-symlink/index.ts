// Contributed from foundry, 2026-08-18 — the second group of host-converging
// modules to arrive that way, after systemd-unit / host-file /
// docker-compose-stack on 2026-08-03.
//
// The comments below cite `ADR-NNNN` and sibling test files by bare name. Those
// are **foundry's**, not this repository's, and they are kept rather than
// stripped because each one is the record of a failure that shaped the code —
// a reference a reader can go and find beats a rationale nobody can check.

// host-symlink — a pointer on this host into the checkout, declared instead of
// remembered.
//
// **Why a link and not a copy.** `host-file` materialises content, and for
// anything a tool reads out of this repo that is the wrong shape twice over.
// It leaves two copies of one file, so an edit to the live one is drift that
// nothing reports until the next apply silently reverts it. And it cannot
// converge a link at all: `readFileSync` follows one, so a link already at the
// path reads as content and compares *equal* — the module reports `unchanged`
// having converged nothing — while a differing declaration makes `writeFileSync`
// write **through** the link and clobber the repo's own source file.
//
// The pattern this serves is already in CLAUDE.md: `services/claude-hooks` and
// `watchdog.sh` are executed out of the checkout by absolute path, so the repo
// is the single copy and editing one needs no apply — only the wiring is
// applied. A hook's wiring is an entry in `settings.json`. For a file a tool
// finds by scanning a fixed directory, the wiring *is* a symlink.
//
// **Not a general file-placement tool.** If the content on the box does not
// have to be the same bytes as the repo's copy, use `host-file`; a link makes
// the two inseparable, which is a promise worth making only when they are
// meant to be one file.

 * - **A target that does not exist.** A dangling link is worse than no link:
 *   the path exists, `ls` shows it, and whatever reads the directory simply
 *   finds nothing there — no error, no apply that reports it.
